# Single Cell RNA-Seq Data Analysis

This project utilizes Python and several key libraries for single-cell RNA-Seq data analysis, including `scanpy`, `numpy`, `scipy`, `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `scikit-learn`, `natsort`, `networkx`, `h5py`, and two graph clustering libraries, `louvain` and `leidenalg`.

## Environment Setup and Installation

1. It is recommended to use [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution) to manage your Python and package environment, but you can also use the Python environment already installed on your machine.

2. Create a new conda environment (optional):

```bash
conda create -n single_cell_analysis python=3.8
conda activate single_cell_analysis

3. Install packages:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
